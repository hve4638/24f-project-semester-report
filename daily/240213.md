Dear JUNYOUNG CHO,

Thank you for reaching out with your technical queries regarding the VTOL drone project. I'm glad to hear that the simulator was successfully run and operated as planned. It's always great to see positive results, especially in complex projects like this.

As HITL simulation project is an open-source initiative supported mainly by enthusiasts currently, the best way to get support and collaborate is through our GitHub repository. By creating separate issues for each topic you've mentioned, not only do you increase the chances of receiving more prompt and specific assistance, but you also contribute to the collective knowledge base, benefiting future developers who might face similar challenges. Please create separate GitHub issues for each problem you're encountering. Remember to include all relevant details, as you did in your email. This will help others understand the context and provide more accurate support.

In case you require prioritized assistance, we could organise paid support. Please inform us if you wish to explore this option. Otherwise, GitHub issues are the most effective way for troubleshooting.

Looking forward to your contributions on GitHub.

Best regards,



Quick hint on 3d Simulator:
1) It's crucial that your system recognizes the GPU with nvidia-smi. Unfortunately, I can't assist with installing NVIDIA drivers as it's highly dependent on your specific hardware setup and needs to be addressed locally.
2) It seems you might be using an outdated version of the 3D Simulator. Please check the latest release at https://github.com/ZilantRobotics/Simulator3d/releases. 
 properly run it, you'll need to launch rosbridge (roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridg
